# GoogleMapsItemsSourceExample
A very basic example of a Xamarin.Forms app using Xamarin.Forms.GoogleMaps and Xamarin.Forms.GoogleMaps.Clustering, binding the map's ItemsSource property to an ObservableCollection.

In order to run this app, make sure to set Google Maps API key in AppDelegate.cs with a real key which can be obtained from Google.
